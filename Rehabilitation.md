# Rehabilitation in Stroke Patients
## Rehab Importance for The Stroke
Reports from clinical and therapist experiences, the vast majority of scholars agree that rehabilitation after stroke has a decisive impact on patients' prognosis. Rehabilitation quality, immediacy, duration, and patients' adherence are crucial factors that directly affect post-stroke survivors' maximum recovery potential. Stroke can cause a decrease in functionality in various ways, depending on the affected brain region. However, the most common and frustrating defects are related to motor and sensory impairments, which often occur in groups of survivors. This is because the motor and sensory fibers are located in the superficial layer of the brain (cortex), which is more susceptible to damage from a stroke.

## Upper Limb Rehabilitation
Rehabilitation aims to help stroke patients regain their general life skills. Upper limb rehabilitation, which focuses on recovering patients' arm, shoulder, hand, and wrist, is an essential part of the overall rehabilitation process. Not only is it complex to control, but human upper limbs also play a critical role in daily activities, such as self-care, intake, dressing, and working. 

Research has shown that early and intensive upper limb rehabilitation can improve outcomes for stroke survivors, including better functional outcomes and restore the life quality before the stroke to the greatest extent. Hence, upper limb rehabilitation is considered a critical component of stroke rehabilitation, and it is often prioritized over other forms of rehabilitation.

## Enum Type of Upper Limb Rehabilitations
Principles of stroke rehabilitation are almost inseparable from inducing neuroplasticity. Based on the systematic review in the field of rehabilitation research in recent years, Canadian Stroke Best Practice Recommendations lists several rehabilitation methods that have a lot of evidence to support their effectiveness [1]: Functional electrical stimulation (FES), mirror therapy and virtual reality therapy. Whether these upper limb rehabilitation methods are implemented in the early or late stage of stroke, they have obvious curative effects in more than two randomized controlled clinical trials.

## Induce Neuroplasticity
The consistency of action and motor intention, one or multiple sensory stimulation at the same time, is an important factor in inducing neuroplasticity [2], and this factor is also reflected in the research direction of these three effective stroke rehabilitation methods.

## Functional electrical stimulation (FES)
Functional electrical stimulation (FES) uses small electrical currents to stimulate the muscles of the affected limb, this rehabilitation method usally targeted at the wrist and forearm muscles to reduce motor impairment and improve function.  promoting movement and strength. Due to the signal blockade cause by the damage to the associated motor cortex, stroke patients have difficult to trigger their bone muscle because their impaired motor control, FES can surrogate patient's motor intention to trigger related accaptor of muscule. In current research grogress,  Also based on the induction principle of neuroplasticity, the current mainstream hypothesis is that if the use of FES can synchronize the patient's motor intentions, there will be better curative effect. Therefore, the FES rehabilitation systems combining electromyography (EMG) or even brain-computer interface (BCI) to predict motor intention have been proposed in recent years [4][5].

## Mirror therapy
Mirror therapy is a type of therapy that is used to release phantom limb pain and improve motor function in stroke patients, especially suitable for stroke patients with hemiplegia. In a trditional mirror therapy treatment, the therapist will ask the patient sitting in front of the mirror box and hidding their affected hand into that mirror box, on the other healthy hand will be asked to place outside of the mirror box, by adjusting the angle between the patient's perspective and the mirror on the mirror box, a affected hand image reflected by the healthy hand will show up in the mirror and create a visual illusion that tricks the brain into thinking that the missing or injured limb is functioning normally, performing the same movement with the healthy hand.

For a treatment based on visual deception, its efficacy is believed to be related to mirror neurons and neuroplasticity principles derived from the human brain.

The basis of mirror therapy is based on the neural plasticity of the brain which can be repaired by itself. If the patient after the stroke keep looking at the weak side of the hand, and constantly inputting negative information to the brain, it will not be conducive to the repair of the brain. Therefore, the mirror is used to reflect the unaffected hand, so that the patient sees the image of the unaffected hand overlapping the affected side of the hand, and establishes the visual illusion of the affected side in the brain.
During the process that the patient observes the movement of the unaffected side in the mirror, the resulting visual illusion replaces the lost proprioceptive input [6] and activates the primary motor area of the brain by positive visual feedback. The premotor area and the somatosensory area promote the repair mechanism of the mirror neuron system in the brain, reorganizing the neural circuits around the brain area to which the damaged part belongs, and recovering normal movements and feelings.
Mirror neurons in the human brain are approximately 20% of all neurons. It can connect the messages and actions received by the brain to each other, and play an important role in the observation, intention understanding, association, imitation, and learning of action.
According to the literature, mirror image therapy was originally used to help patients with upper limb amputation and recovery from the sensation of phantom limb and phantom limb pain. In 1995, for the first time, scholars used the mirror therapy method for mirror therapy in stroke cases and found that stroke patients with mild, moderate, and severe limb disability showed progress in the joint activity, speed, and accuracy. This not only increases the ability of the upper limbs but also encourages patients to increase the usage of the affected side in their daily lives [7].

## The limitation of traditional MT
In traditional mirror therapy, only a simple mirror box is used as a tool. Increasing numbers of medical studies have shown that mirror therapy has a good effect on rehabilitation after stroke. Although mirror therapy has been applied to hemiplegia rehabilitation, such as improving functioning in daily life, with more than 30 minutes of general rehabilitation training, the effectiveness of the method may be related to the current way mirror therapy is applied.
In addition to the lack of stimulation sources, because of the limited area of ??the mirror, the range of motion of the patient's limbs is limited; the movement beyond the scope of the mirror is not possible, and the rehabilitation action that can be performed is also limited.
