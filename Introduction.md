# Introduction
Stroke is a prevalent yet fatal condition among modern humans, usually caused by cerebrovascular events such as embolism or rupture. These events result in the death of brain neurons and cause semi-permanent disabilities. Depending on the affected brain region, stroke survivors may experience various sequelae such as lack of spatial awareness, motor dysfunction, cognitive impairment, and paralysis, among others. Hemiplegia is the most common symptom, causing unintentional trembling, difficulty in controlling bone muscles, and leading to daily life challenges for patients. The 2022 global stroke fact sheet reveals that the prevalence rate of stroke is steadily increasing, with a forecast that one in four people will experience a stroke in their lifetime, cause significant burdens for survivors and their families. Unfortunately, this phenomenon is particularly prevalent in underdeveloped countries.

Many current rehabilitation treatments for hemiplegic stroke patients are grounded in the theory of neuroplasticity, which refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and grow by altering its neural connections over time [1]. This phenomenon involves rewiring the brain to function differently from its previous state. Related research suggests that multisensory stimulation and explicit feedback principles should be implemented for motor-oriented rehabilitation
